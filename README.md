# WildSight

## Project Overview

WildSight is a full-stack wildlife observation, analytics, and prediction platform designed to help users record, explore, and understand wildlife sightings.

The project begins with bird observations but is architected to support all wildlife, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects, marine life, and plants. Each observation will eventually be enriched with environmental data such as weather, habitat, season, and location to provide deeper insights and power machine learning models that predict the likelihood of observing particular species under specific conditions.

WildSight is being developed as a production-quality software engineering portfolio project with an emphasis on scalable architecture, maintainable code, clean design, and modern development practices.
